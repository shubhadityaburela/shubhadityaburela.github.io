Hello!!, I am Shubhaditya. I am Ph.D. student in the Institute of Mathematics at the Technical University of Berlin. I am involved in the project "Model reduction of multiple transported fronts with topological changes" under the Research Training Group, Differential Equation- and Data-driven Models in Life Sciences and Fluid Dynamics [(DAEDALUS)](https://www.daedalus.berlin), RTG 2433 funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG)
