Hello!!, I am Shubhaditya. I am Ph.D. student in the Institute of Mathematics at the Technical University of Berlin. I am involved in the project "Model reduction of multiple transported fronts with topological changes" under the Research Training Group, Differential Equation- and Data-driven Models in Life Sciences and Fluid Dynamics [(DAEDALUS)](https://www.daedalus.berlin), RTG 2433 funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG)
#This is some random text -- this should change frontend. We have now changed!! realized??
#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
#Let us see if this works or not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
