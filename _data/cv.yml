      year: Oct 2021 - present
      description:
        - I am currently working as a research associate at TU Berlin in the Institute of Fluid Mechanics and Technical Acoustics. I work on developing reduced order models for transport problems with sharp-moving fronts like shock waves and flame fronts. My work involves developing and programming intrusive and data-based methods (machine learning methods) for model reduction. Additionally, I also work on reactive flows and methods for developing model order reduction methods for such fluid flows.

      description:
        - I worked on optimizing the computational cost of the Hessian tensor accumulation in deep neural networks by developing a Dynamic Programming algorithm for Hessian Chaining Problem which is generated by the second-order optimization of the loss function of a feedforward deep neural network. The loss functions are multivariate composite vector functions that give rise to a chain of Jacobians and Hessians multiplied together. The complexity of the above combinatorial problem is brought down to polynomial time from NP-complete via a well-designed Dynamic programming algorithm.

      description:
        - I worked on developing a Finite Element solver for the Thermo-hydrodynamic analysis of Thrust Bearings in automotive turbochargers. My work comprised of writing FORTRAN subroutines for meshing the geometry, implementing various mathematical models namely the Cavitation model, Asperity contact model, and Thermal model, and writing subroutines for sparsifying the system and post-processing the results in Paraview. The models implemented are examples of Transient Convection-Diffusion type of equations with source terms which are solved by Stabilized Finite Element Methods instead of simple Galerkin formulation. Transient dynamic simulations of the turbocharger assembly are performed and the friction, oil flow, pressure, and temperature results are then sufficiently validated with the available bearing friction measurements obtained from the test bench. The solver is part of a bigger commercial Multi-body dynamics software package FEV Virtual Engine which is based on the MSC Adams software.

        - As an executive in the Service training department, I was involved in imparting training to the Dealer technicians on Honda technology and serviceability aspects including engine and transmission overhauling of Honda cars. Worked on standardizing the service bays in Honda Dealerships all across India. Additionally, I was involved in the project for the development of 3D content for training purposes and the development of a web-based system for efficiently managing and customizing training.

      description: We worked on developing a promo-recommendation model based on xg-boost that learns from the synthetically generated dataset containing the user responses for different promotional campaigns. Various tests were run with different parameters to conclude that the presence of a cohort structure in the user data results in better prediction accuracy. Moreover, a new clustering algorithm was developed to find out the inherent cohort structure in the data when it is not given.

      year: Jun 2021 - Aug 2021
      description: As part of GSoC-2021, I worked with the team developing MBDyn software. MBDyn is an open-source Multibody Dynamics analysis software. It has been developed at the Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Aerospaziali (formerly Dipartimento di Ingegneria Aerospaziale) of the University "Politecnico di Milano", Italy. The topic of my project was "Implementing an Unsteady Vortex-Lattice aerodynamic element" in the MBDyn code base written in C++. My target was to create a coupling between the MBDyn solver and the pre-compiled UVLM (Unsteady Vortex Lattice Method) library. The MBDyn subsystem was responsible for the kinematic part of the problem and the UVLM library was responsible for the aerodynamic part of the problem. The UVLM library computed the aerodynamic forces and moments and the coupled system served as an intermediate to transfer the forces and moments to the MBDyn subsystem and the kinematic data back to the UVLM subsystem from the MBDyn at each and every time step.
